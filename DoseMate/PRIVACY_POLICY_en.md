# DoseMate Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: December 11, 2025**

DoseMate (hereinafter referred to as "Service") values users' personal information and complies with the Personal Information Protection Act and the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection.
This Service is a **local-based app that does not operate a separate server**, and the developer does not collect users' personal information or transmit it to external servers.

This Privacy Policy explains how personal information is managed and protected so that users can use the Service with confidence.

## Article 1 (Items of Personal Information Collected and Collection Methods)
This Service does not have a membership registration feature, and **the developer does not transmit or collect users' personal information to servers operated by the developer.**
However, the following information may be processed within the app (on the user's device) to provide smooth functionality during the use of the Service.

1. **Information Processed (Stored on Device)**
    - Medication information (medication name, dosage time, dosage, etc.)
    - Medication records and notes
    - User settings (notification settings, etc.)
    - Profile information (nickname arbitrarily entered by the user, etc.)

2. **Apple HealthKit Integration (Planned for Future Support)**
    - The current version does not provide HealthKit integration features.
    - HealthKit integration functionality is planned to be added in future updates. When implemented, if users allow 'Health' app integration, medication records can be read from and written to the Apple HealthKit database.
    - HealthKit data is managed according to Apple's security policy and is not transmitted to the developer's server.

## Article 2 (Purpose of Processing Personal Information)
All information entered in the app is used only for the following purposes and is processed only within the user's device.
1. Medication schedule management and notification provision
2. Medication record statistics confirmation
3. Maintenance of in-app feature settings

## Article 3 (Provision of Personal Information to Third Parties)
The Service does not provide users' personal information to third parties. All data exists only on the user's device, so the developer has no authority or technical means to access that information.

However, if users use the backup function (iCloud, etc.) provided by the iOS operating system, data may be encrypted and stored on Apple Inc.'s servers, which follows Apple's Privacy Policy.

## Article 4 (Retention and Use Period of Personal Information)
1. **Retention Period**: From the start date of service use until app deletion
2. Since this Service does not have a separate server, **all personal information and data stored on the device are destroyed (deleted) immediately when the user deletes the app.**

## Article 5 (Users' Rights and Exercise Methods)
1. Users can view, modify, or delete their information at any time through in-app settings.
2. Users can terminate the service use contract and destroy all data by deleting the app.
3. When HealthKit integration features are provided, data access permissions can be revoked at any time in iOS Settings > Health > Data Access and Devices.

## Article 6 (Measures to Ensure Personal Information Safety)
The Service takes the following measures to protect users' personal information:
1. **No Server Operation**: By not operating a central server, which is the main route of personal information leakage, the risk of large-scale data leakage through hacking has been fundamentally blocked.
2. **Use of OS Security Features**: Complies with iOS's Sandbox policy to protect users' data from unauthorized access by external apps.

## Article 7 (Personal Information Protection Officer)
Although the Service does not directly collect personal information as it does not operate a server, if you have any inquiries related to the use of the Service, please contact us at the following address.

- **Personal Information Protection Officer**: BBDyno (Developer)
- **Email**: della.kimko@gmail.com

## Article 8 (Notice of Policy Changes)
This Privacy Policy may be added, deleted, or modified according to changes in laws, policies, or security technologies, and in the event of changes, the reasons and contents of changes will be announced through in-app notices.
